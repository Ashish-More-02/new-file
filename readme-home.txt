This file has become a GitHub repository and I have use to function 
"git init " to initialise this folder as a git folder .

1) track the files by using "git add ." Means this file can now be viewed by GitHub and it is in staging area (some sort of temporary area)

2) I have added the origin(means the place where the code have to pushed ) to this file already , and it have the "main"  Branch , just type the command "git branch " to check which branch it is using now .

3) first step is to add then commit and , commit by using this command 
"  git commit -m "enter your message here "  "

4) once the file is committed it is ready to be pushed onto our repository created on the GitHub account , to push the file use this command 
"  git push origin -u 'branch-name'  " here the branch is " main "

5) so our code will be successfully pushed onto the website .

Earlier I was having the error that it was unable to sign in due to it was not allowed to do sign in / authentication using username and password , and I was trying to do it in terminal , but when I did this in vscode terminal then it worked , I gave the authentication popup window !

I will stop here now , cause my hands are paining a lot !
